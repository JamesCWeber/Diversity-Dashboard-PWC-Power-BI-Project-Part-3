## Introduction
This dashboard is final part of a project from the [PwC Power BI micro-internship](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg) hosted by Forage. Pricewaterhouse Coopers International Limited (PwC) is a multinational professional services brand of firms that specializs in auditing and tax and business consulting.

In this task, the Human Resources department for PhoneNow, a fictional telecom company, has tasked me to construct a dashboard about gender balance. The purpose of creating the dashboard is to help identify issues that may cause gender inbalance at the executive level.

## Problem Statement
PhoneNow's Human Resources dapartment consider diversity and inclusions as business imperatives. The department is working hard to address the gender inbalance at the executive management level but they are seeing no progress in their efforts. The department requests a dashboard that highlights relevant Key Perfromance Indicators which can indicate portential solutions to solving the gender inbalance issue at the executive management level.
